# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects that I've worked on, demonstrating my skills and expertise in exploring, visualizing, and deriving insights from various datasets. Each project is a testament to my ability to translate raw data into meaningful and actionable conclusions. Feel free to explore the projects listed below.

## Projects

### 1. [Bike Rideshare Activity Analysis](./bike-rideshare-activity-analysis)

In this project, I combined Excel's advanced functions, including conditional formatting, with Python's Pandas library to gather and preprocess public data from a bike rideshare service. This meticulous process yielded a pristine dataset, primed for analysis. Leveraging Tableau, I translated this data into a user-friendly dashboard, effectively displaying essential metrics and trends.

### 2. [Coffee Sales Dashboard](./coffee-sales-dashboard-excel)

I cleaned and standardized a dataset of 10,000+ entries in Excel via VLOOKUP, enabling data consistency and preparedness.  I then created a pivot table for an in-depth, four-year analysis of coffee sales trends. Additionally, I designed an interactive dashboard using those pivot tables to visually communicate and enhance comprehension of sales patterns among various coffee types.

### 3. [COVID Outbreak Exploratory Analysis](./covid-outbreak-analysis)

Incorporating SQL for data exploration and refinement, I analyzed global COVID-19 infection rates and deaths throughout the initial outbreak year. This led to insightful observations on pandemic trends. Complementing this, a Tableau dashboard visually conveyed infection and death trends, enhancing comprehension of the virus's inaugural year impact.

### 4. [King's County Home Sales Analysis](./kings-county-home-sales)

In this project, I performed an extensive analysis of housing sales in King's County, Washington, uncovering crucial trends and correlations between home conditions and sale prices. By creating an interactive Tableau dashboard, I enabled stakeholders to intuitively interpret sales trends across specific areas, enhancing comprehension of the dataset's insights.

### 5. [London Bike Sharing Analysis](./london-bike-sharing-analysis)

Incorporating Kaggle's KPI in Python, I imported London bike sharing public data and harnessed Pandas to meticulously explore and refine a year's worth of data, culminating in a pristine dataset for analysis. The ensuing Tableau dashboard visually encapsulated vital metrics, patterns, and temporal trends, enabling viewers to seamlessly comprehend bike usage under diverse weather conditions and seasonal timeframes.

### 6. [Powerball Analysis](./powerball-analysis)

I employed Excel and Python to enhance the formatting and quality of historical Powerball winning number data, enabling detailed statistical analysis. By leveraging Pandas, I processed nearly three decades' worth of drawing and winner data, uncovering significant trends and patterns, and then employed Tableau to create an informative dashboard illustrating these insights for states participating in the lottery.

## Tools and Technologies
